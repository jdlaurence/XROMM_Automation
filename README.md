# XROMM Tools

## Motivation
The XROMM community continues to grow rapidly, as does the use of XROMM data. Concurrently, the scientific community has adopted higher standards of data reproducibility and transparency of analysis; more often than not, researchers are required to submit both their data and code alongside a manuscript.
The XROMM_MayaTools shelf, the standard toolbox for XROMM data processing, is powerful and user-friendly but is not ideal for the programmatic automation of data analysis. Thus, the motivation for the performing these operations outside of Maya is to increase **reproducibility**, **transparency**, and **ease of batch processing**.

## What this is, and what this is not
Replicates Mayatools functions, allows for batch processing. Does not fully eliminate maya from workflow, still need to..
